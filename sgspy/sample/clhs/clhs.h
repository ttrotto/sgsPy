/**
 * @ingroup clhs
 * This function is responsible for three different tasks as it reads through the raster.
 * The raster is read in blocks, so as to be as memory efficient as possible and 
 * avoid the potential issue of a raster which is too large to fit in memory.
 *
 * The three tasks are as follows:
 *  - calculate the quantile values for every feature, where the number of equally sized
 *  quantiles is the sample size.
 *  - calculate the correltion matrix of the features in the raster.
 *  - Save points, along with their x/y coordinates.
 *
 * QUANTILES:
 * MKL (Math Kernel Library) is used to calculate the quantiles using a quantile streaming
 * algorithm. As the pixels are iterated through, each pixel is a row an each feature
 * is a column -- this is because it is how the correlation matrix calculation expects
 * the values to be, but it also simplifies the removal of nan pixels. However,
 * the quantile calculation is done per-feature, so each feature has it's own vector of 
 * values which are copied over from the original matrix while reading. These are
 * in the quantileBuffers vector of vectors. 
 *
 * Additionally, there are seperate MKL functions for single precision vs double precision
 * floating point values. For this reason, the type is passed (in addition to being templated)
 * so that the correct MKL function is called according to the data type of the raster.
 *
 * Due to the template function also being passed, the pointer type passed to those type-specific
 * MKL functions must be casted to the correct type. This is because, the C++ compiler is not
 * aware that the float template will never be passed along with a type of GDT_Float64, and double
 * will never be passed along with a type of GDT_Float32.
 *
 * CORRELATION:
 * oneDAL is used to calculate the correlation matrix of the raster features using a streaming
 * algorithm. The features are read such that a pixel corresponds to a row and a feature
 * corresponds to a column in the buffer passed to the quantile streaming algorithm. This is to
 * simplify the removal of nan pixels, and to maximize cache-line efficiency.
 *
 * POINTS:
 * The most obvious way to calculate clhs would be to read the entire raster into memory, remove
 * the nan pixels, then run the simulated annealing algorithm over the entire raster. Essentially,
 * every pixel in the raster has an equal chance of being selected. This method however falls apart
 * when there are enough pixels so as to be encredibly memory-inefficent, or so many that they can't
 * fit in memory at once. In this case, we cannot store the features of every single pixel. 
 *
 * Instead, as we iterate through the raster we randomly select pixels which will be added to a pool. The pixels
 * within that pool are options for being added to the latin hypercube. The probability of each pixel
 * being added to this pool depends on the total size of the raster (as well as the number of accessible
 * pixels, if the access parameter is given), but every accessible pixel has an equal chance of being
 * included in the pool. The size goal for the pool is 10,000,000 pixels because it is (hopefully) enough
 * to give the simulated annealing algorithm all the options for quantiles it needs, without breaking memory.
 * If the raster has a small enough number of pixels however, they will all be added to the pool.

/**
 * @ingroup clhs
 * This function is responsible for selecting the samples will be in the final sample
 * using the Conditioned Latin Hypercube Sampling (clhs) method. The CLHSDataManager
 * contains a pool of points which may be selected, as well as objective functions which
 * will calculate how good each sample is depending on the number of samples within
 * each features quantiles, and how closely matching the correlation matrices are between
 * the sample compared to the entire sample space.
 *
 * The clhs method uses a simulated annealing algorithm, wherein the sample is constanty being
 * updated and tested by replacing one of the samples. The old vs new samples are compared usign
 * the objective functions, and the likelyhood that the sample is added (whether it's an improvement
 * or not) depends both on a random probability, and the tempreature parameter which decreases after
 * every iteration. Essentially, at the start of the algorithm it is far more likely that a sample
 * may be accepted if it makes the objective function worse. The reason why the algorithm doesn't always
 * accept an improvement and reject a decrease is to avoid finding a local maximum (which is not a
 * global maximum). At the start of each iteration, there is also a 50% chance that the sample removed
 * is NOT random, but removed from the quantile which has the most samples (essentially removing the 
 * 'worst' pixel).
 *
 * Once all of the samples are chosen, they are added to the output layer and the function completes.

/**
 * @ingroup clhs
 * This function conducts Conditioned Latin Hypercube Sampling (CLHS) on a given raster.
 *
 * First, metadata is acquired for each band within the raster, and an output vector
 * file is created in-memory which is where chosen sample points will be written to.
 *
 * The readRaster() function is called, which iterates through the raster in blocks
 * and calculates the quantiles for each feature, as well as the correlation matrix,
 * for the entire sampling space. It also selects pixels and adds them to a pool.
 *
 * The selectSamples() function utilizes a simulated annealing algorithm taking
 * into account the differences in correlation matrix between the sample and the
 * overall sample space, as well as how close to a latin hypercube the sample is.
 * The points which this algorithm choses from are from the pool of pixels added
 * in the readRaster() function.
