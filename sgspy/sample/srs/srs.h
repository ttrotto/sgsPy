/**
 * @ingroup srs
 * This function uses random sampling to determine the location
 * of sample plots given a raster image.
 *
 * First, metadata is acquired on the first raster band, which is 
 * to be read to check and ensure samples don't occur over nodata pixels.
 *
 * Next, and output vector dataset is created as an in-memory dataset.
 * If the user specifies a filename, this in-memory dataset will be 
 * written to disk in a different format after all points have been added.
 *
 * An Access struct is created, which creates a raster dataset containing
 * a rasterized version of access buffers. This raster will be 1 over
 * accessible areas. In the case where there is no access vector given,
 * the structs 'used' member will be false and no processing or rasterization
 * will be done.
 *
 * An Existing struct is created, which retains information on already existing
 * sample points passed in the form of a vector dataset. The points are iterated
 * through and added to the output dataset. The points are also added to a set,
 * and during iteration the indexes of every pixel will be checked against this set
 * to ensure there are no duplicate pixels. In the case whre there is no existing
 * vector given, the structs 'used' member will be false and no processing
 * will be done.
 *
 * Next, a rng() function is created usign the xoshiro library, the specific
 * randm number generator is the xoshrio256++
 * https://vigna.di.unimi.it/ftp/papers/ScrambledLinear.pdf	
 *
 * The impetus behind usign the rng() function to determine which pixels
 * should be added DURING iteration, rather than afterwards, is it removes the
 * necessity of storing every available pixel, which quickly becomes extrordinarily
 * inefficient for large rasters. Rather, for pixels which are accessible, not nan,
 * and not already existing, there is a pre-determined percentage chance to be stored
 * which uses this random number generator. An over-estimation for the percentage
 * chance is made, because it is better to have too many than not enough possible options
 * to sample from. This over-estimation might result in the storage of 2x-3x extra pixels
 * rather than the many orders of magnitude extra storage of adding all pixels. The
 * calculation for this percentage is done and explained in detail in the
 * getProbabilityMultiplier() function.
 *
 * Then, the raster is processed in one of two ways. One using a random access
 * strategy where random indexes are calculated and checked for validity, and 
 * another where the entire raster is read. The decision between these two
 * is calculated to minimize the number of blocks read into memory, as this
 * is the main bottleneck in processing time.
 *
 * Once all possible pixels have been selected, there may be extra
 * indices in the indicies vector. Because simply sampling the first
 * few we need would might NOT be in a random order, the indices are first shuffled.
 * After being shuffled, the indexes are added to the output dataset
 * as samples if they don't occur within mindist if an already existing pixel.

	// When using the Simple Random Sampling (srs) method, there is no requirement that the pixels
	// have any relation to each other or represent any kind of distribution in the overall raster.
	// This means that there is no requirement to read through the entire raster image.

	// In some cases, it may be faster to select pixels at random from the image, hoping they are
	//  1. not nan
	//  2. acessible

	// However, there are cases when more blocks will be read into memory by randomly selecting 
	// pixels compared to reading through the whole raster. This is because random access patterns
	// have a VERY low hit rate in the cache, leading to significant thrashing -- we have to assume
	// every time a pixel is read a block is read into the cache whereas when the entire raster is
	// read sequentially, a new block must be read into the cache ONLY when the first pixel in that
	// block is looked at.

	// blocks read into memory and use that to generate random pixels, assuming that half of the
